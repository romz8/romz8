## Hi there, I'm Romain üëã

I‚Äôm a software engineer with a solid foundation in C, C++, Python, and JavaScript, and an insatiable curiosity for backend engineering, fintech, data, and blockchain. I previously worked as a trader in derivatives and later in the energy sector before founding and running a startup for 3 years ‚Äî a marketplace and subscription services for pet supplies. Feel free to connect if you‚Äôd like to discuss any of these topics :)
